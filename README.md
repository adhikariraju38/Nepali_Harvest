Harvesting the future of agriculture: Predicting plant health and optimal harvest times


## Team Info

Team Name: Deep Learners
Theme: Agriculture

## Introduction

Our idea is based on the Agriculture theme. Based on the theme, we are about to develop a web page or app that will mostly focus on the disease prediction of different types of plants through the leaves of those plants, combined with a system that will be capable of predicting which crops should be harvested right now based on some parameter such as temperature, humidity, etc. This concept was created with the intention of addressing a problem that new farmers face on a daily basis. Farmers would easily identify whether their crops are healthy or not and what precautions should be taken to solve the problem if the crops are not in good condition, along with the problem of which crops will be more beneficial to harvest in this season for more benefits.
The objectives of the proposed web page or app are:

•    To predict diseases in different types of plants using images of their leaves
•    To predict which crops should be harvested based on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity
•    To assist new farmers in identifying the health of their crops and taking appropriate precautions
•    To aid farmers in determining which crops will be most beneficial to harvest in a given season for maximum yield and profitability.


## Technology Used

####### Frontend

* React JS

####### Backend

* Flask
* ExpressJS

####### Machine Learning

* MACHINE LEARNING

1. We have used ML model to predict the best product that can be grown in that given time based on the parameter related to Enviroment, which contains parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Ph leve of soil, Potassium and Nitrogen components of the soil.
2. And for plant doctor we have used ResNet model to predict different disesse that apper in the leaf of different plant.


## Business Model

There are several potential business models that could be used for this product:

    1. Subscription-based model: In this model, farmers would pay a monthly or annual fee to access the disease prediction and crop harvest prediction features of the app or web page.

    2. Pay-per-use model: In this model, farmers would be charged a fee each time they use the disease prediction or crop harvest prediction features of the app or web page.

    3. Advertising-based model: In this model, the app or web page would be free to use for farmers, but it would include advertising from companies that sell agricultural products or services.

    4. Data-driven model: In this model, the company would collect data from the farmers who use the app or web page and then sell insights and analysis derived from that data to other companies in the agriculture industry.

    5. Partnership model: In this model, the company would partner with agricultural research institutions, seed companies, and fertilizer and pesticide companies to provide farmers with a complete       solution for crop management and disease prediction.


## Future Idea

. A simple and efficient algorithm based on Nepali data.
. Platform for farmers and users to add and purchase products.
. Automatic crop monitoring system.
. Wide range of crops and fruits catering to the specific needs of Nepali farmers.
. User-friendly interface for easy navigation and transactions.
